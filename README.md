## Objective  
A serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a test-driven development (TDD) and Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events

## Key Features
- Filter events by city.
- Show/hide event details.
- Specify number of events.
- Use the app when offline.
- Add an app shortcut to the home screen.
- View a chart showing the number of upcoming events by city.

## User Stories
- Filter events by city to see the list of events that take place in that city.
- Show/hide event details for more/less information about an event.
- Specify the number of events to view in the app at once.
- Use the app when offline but being updated with the events selected when online
- Add the app shortcut to home screen
- See a chart showing the upcoming events in each city.

## Technical Requirements:
- React application.
- Built using the TDD technique.
- Use the Google Calendar API and OAuth2 authentication flow.
- Use serverless functions (AWS lambda) for the authorization server.
- Code hosted in a Git repository on GitHub.
- App running on latest Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Opera and IE11.
- Display well on all screen sizes (mobile and tablet) widths of 1920px-320px.
- Pass Lighthouseâ€™s PWA checklist .
- Work offline or in slow network conditions with the help of a service worker.
- Able to install the app on desktop or add it to the home screen on mobile.
- Dployed on GitHub Pages.
- API call must use React axios and async/await.
- Implement an alert system (OOP approach) to show information to the user.
- Make use of data visualization (recharts).
- Covered by tests with a coverage rate >= 90%.
- Monitored using an online monitoring tool.
